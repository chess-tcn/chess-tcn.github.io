# Chess TCN Encoder & Decoder
[![Open in browser](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chess-tcn/chess-tcn.github.io/refs/heads/main/assets/open.svg)](https://chess-tcn.github.io)

A browser-based tool to encode and decode **TCN**, a move format used by **Chess.com**'s live-game API.

## What is TCN?
TCN is how **Chess.com** ships move lists in its JSON API.

A sample endpoint:
```
https://www.chess.com/callback/live/game/{gameId}
```
returns a `moveList` field containing a TCN string.

## Features
- Decode **TCN** into **PGN**
- Encode **PGN** into **TCN**

## Live Demo
Open in any modern browser:

https://chess-tcn.github.io

## Example
1. Paste a TCN string from the Chess.com APIâ€™s `moveList` field. For example, `mC0Kgv7Tbq5Qlt9IqHT7cM1TMFWOHs2MFwZRfm6Eeg`.
2. See it rendered as a PGN game
3. Edit PGN and re-encode back to TCN
